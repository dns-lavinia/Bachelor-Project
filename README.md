# Bachelor-Project

The current project is intended to be used as part of the Bachelor Thesis. 

For this, I chose to bring my own implementation of a swarm robotics system that
uses collaboration in a foraging task and further experiment on how it can be 
improved based on the article that can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/6/2856).

## Running the project
Before running the project, all the needed python packages have to be installed.

If they are not already, simply run `pip install requirements.txt` from a terminal 
from the folder the file `requirements.txt` is from.
